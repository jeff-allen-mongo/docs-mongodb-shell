   macOS may prevent ``mongosh`` from running after installation. If
   you receive a security error when starting ``mongosh`` indicating
   that the developer could not be identified or verified, run
   the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/mongosh
...
