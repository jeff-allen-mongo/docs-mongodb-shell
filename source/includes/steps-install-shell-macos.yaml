   You can either:

   - Copy the binaries into a directory listed in your ``PATH``
     variable, such as ``/usr/local/bin`` (Update
     ``/path/to/mongosh`` with your installation directory as
     appropriate)

     .. code-block:: sh

       sudo cp /path/to/mongosh /usr/local/bin/

   - Create symbolic links to the binaries from a directory listed in
     your ``PATH`` variable, such as ``/usr/local/bin`` (Update
     ``/path/to/mongosh`` with your installation directory as
     appropriate):

     .. code-block:: sh

       sudo ln -s  /path/to/mongosh /usr/local/bin/

...
